# Day 5 â€“  20 June 2025  

**Python Data Structures and Operators ** 

### **1. Set in Python**

- **Introduced the concept of `set`** â€“ an unordered, unindexed collection of unique values.
- **Sets automatically eliminate duplicates.**
- **Performed set operations like intersection** to find mutual data between sets.
- **Discussed limitations of sets** such as lack of indexing and unpredictable ordering.
- **Applied sets** in examples like social media follower management.

### **2. Dictionary in Python**

- **Learned about dictionaries** as key-value pair containers.
- **Created nested dictionaries** for representing structured data (e.g., flight booking).
- **Understood mutability** of dictionaries and the role of unique, immutable keys.
- **Captured and organized real-world data** using dictionaries.

---

### **3. Taking User Input and Type Conversion**

- **Used `input()` function** to accept data dynamically from users.
- **Applied typecasting** with `int()` and `float()` for numeric inputs.
- **Captured multiple values from users** and stored them in structured format.
- **Learned to make interactive scripts** for collecting booking or feedback data.

---

### **4. Operators in Python**

#### **a. Arithmetic Operators**
- Used `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**` for performing mathematical operations.
- Applied to compute cab fare, tax, and total payment.

#### **b. Conditional Operators**
- Compared values using `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`.
- Used for validating conditions such as wallet balance vs fare cost.

#### **c. Logical Operators**
- Used `and`, `or` for combining multiple conditions.
- Validated access scenarios (e.g., Internet and GPS for Google Maps).

#### **d. Assignment Operators**
- Applied `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `**=`, `//=`, `%=` for updating variable values.
- Used for quantity counters and value modifications.

#### **e. Bitwise Operators**
- Explored `&` and `|` for bit-level operations.
- Understood their application in security and binary computations.

## **Key Learnings**

- Differentiated between list, set, and dictionary based on use case.
- Built real-life applications using nested dictionaries.
- Collected and processed user input for dynamic programs.
- Practiced all categories of Python operators in real-world logic.
- Reinforced understanding using practical scenarios like travel booking and user conditions.
